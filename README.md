## Overview

A major project for the 4990A course where we simulate autonomous vehicles in the Unity game engine. This project uses methodologies from the <a href="https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim">Udacity Car Simulator</a> and Microsoft's <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/airsim">Airsim</a>. Autonomous vehicles require a large amount of data that can be complex and expensive to collect in the real world. The ability to simulate autonomous vehicles in a photorealistic environment provides a much more cost effective and efficient way to generate useful data.

## Demo

The gif above shows a short clip of the simulated vehicle driving fully autonomously through a trained model. There are three mounted cameras on the hood of the car that feed images into the model and receives steering predictions and speed/throttle/break instructions in order to safely maneuver around curved roads and remain safely in the lane.
